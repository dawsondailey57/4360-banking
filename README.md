When you open BankingSoftware.py, login with username:
zeep, zorp, or glorp
their respective passwords are Lemon4, Lime2, and Orange7
I recommend not logging into glorp because he has 6 cents to his name.
You can then do /balance, /transfer, /withdraw, and /quit
/balance will allow you to choose an account to check the balance of
/transfer will let you move money to the target account, and take that amount of money out of the other account to accomplish this
/withdraw will let you choose an account to withdraw money from, and then subtract the amount you withdraw from the account and "give you the money"
/quit will end the loop
